# About This Website

## Technology

This website is built with:

- **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)** 4.3 - A static site generator that transforms markdown and data files into HTML
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)** 5.3.3 - Modern CSS framework for responsive design
- **[Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)** (Darkly theme) - Styled Bootstrap theme
- **[Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)** - Comprehensive icon library

All pages are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for easy editing. Content like publications, news, and team members are stored as YAML data files in the `_data/` folder, making updates straightforward without touching code.

## Repository

The source code is available on GitHub:

**[github.com/gavinsdavies/umneutrino](https://github.com/gavinsdavies/umneutrino)**

For detailed build instructions, deployment guides, and contribution guidelines, see the [README.md](https://github.com/gavinsdavies/umneutrino/blob/main/README.md).

## Credits

This website was originally inspired by the excellent [Allan Lab](https://github.com/allanlab/allanlab) template created by the Allan Lab at Leiden University. Since then, it has been significantly modified and extended to meet the specific needs of the UM Neutrino research group, including:

- Migration to Bootstrap 5
- Custom research experiment pages
- Interactive team map
- Enhanced news filtering
- Custom carousel components
- Darkly theme integration

We're grateful to the Allan Lab for open-sourcing their original template.
