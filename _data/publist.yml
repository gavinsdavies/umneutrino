  description: This Letter reports a search for charge-parity (CP) symmetry violating non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter using the NOvA Experiment, and examines their effects on the determination of the standard oscillation parameters.

- title: "Expanding neutrino oscillation parameter measurements in NOvA using a Bayesian approach"
  image: prd-110-012005-fig7.png
  description: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that measures oscillations in charged-current 𝜈<sub>𝜇</sub>→𝜈<sub>𝜇</sub> (disappearance) and 𝜈<sub>𝜇</sub>→𝜈<sub>𝑒</sub> (appearance) channels, and their antineutrino counterparts, using neutrinos of energies around 2 GeV over a distance of 810 km. In this work we reanalyze the dataset first examined in our previous paper <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.032004">Phys. Rev. D 106, 032004 (2022)</a> using an alternative statistical approach based on Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo. We measure oscillation parameters consistent with the previous results.
